Welcome to my website! Here you can find what I do, what I have done and what I plan to do.


Biography
======
As a postgraduate researcher in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics at the University of Southampton, I am committed to exploring the mathematical structures underpinning various quantum field theories. My research focuses particularly on the intricate interplay between algebraic and geometric properties, employing advanced techniques from algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, category theory, and related fields. My current projects involve the study of Hopf algebras, Feynman integrals, and their applications within modern theoretical physics.

Before my PhD, I was doing an integrated Master's at the University of Leeds. During my time in Leeds, I developed a fascination with continuous symmetries through Noether's theorem. This led me down the path of Supersymmetric Field Theories and I gained deeper insight into Lie groups and their algebras. In particular, Graded Lie Algebras and their representation in superspace. My Master's dissertation can be found [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.31913.71524).

I have also been a part-time tutor at Lextra Learning since Nov 2019, where I help students achieve their academic goals in Mathematics, Further Mathematics, and Physics. I prepare them for A-level exams and Cambridge STEP entry exams, using my strong background and experience in these subjects. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and enthusiasm for physics and mathematics with my students and enabling them to develop their skills and confidence.
